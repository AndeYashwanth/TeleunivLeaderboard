This repo helps to send email to me when my college leaderboard updates with the winner.<br>
Initially the previous winner names are stored in a file leaderboard.txt.
leaderboard.php logins to the website using username and password and gets the required leaderboard page. Checks if there are any new winners by comparing with leaderboard.txt and send the email if any.<br>
Manally downloaded the html page from the leaderboard page.
